1. Java | Spring Boot | HTML | CSS | JavaScript | ReactJs | MySQL
2. Tools: Eclipse IDE, Visual Studio code, Post man

4. Developed room management features for admins to add, update, and delete room listings. Admins can also view a list of all rooms and filter available rooms based on date to manage bookings efficiently.
5. Users can browse all available rooms, filter by date, and book rooms. Implemented booking functionality with real-time availability checks using MySQL to prevent overbooking.
6. Backend built with Java and Spring Boot, connected to a MySQL database for persistent storage. Frontend developed using React.js for dynamic UI components, and styled with HTML and CSS for responsive, user-friendly design.
